Ants spread in random directions and look for food. 
While looking for food they lay down pheromone trails so they can find their way back home after finding food. 
When they find food they lay down pheromone trails so that other ants can make their way to the food while looking for the colony. 
If ant takes the last food on a pile, it sets down repellent so that other ants know this food pile is exhausted.
